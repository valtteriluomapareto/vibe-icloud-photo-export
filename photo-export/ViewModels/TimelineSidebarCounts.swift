/// Loader for the per-(year, month) total + adjusted asset counts the
/// timeline sidebar's `YearRow` and `MonthRow` need to compute their progress
/// badges.
///
/// Issue #20: previously these dicts were populated lazily — total counts
/// only when a year was expanded (`computeMonthsWithAssets(for:)`), adjusted
/// counts only when each `MonthRow` rendered (`.task(id:)` on the row). For
/// collapsed years, both dicts were empty for that year's months, so
/// `YearRow`'s progress badge could not compute and rendered nothing.
/// Subsequent updates during a long export went unnoticed unless the user
/// expanded the year.
///
/// This loader fixes that by fanning out async fetches for **every** known
/// year × month at startup, using the existing cached count APIs
/// (`PhotoLibraryService.cachedCountAssets(in:)` and
/// `cachedCountAdjustedAssets(in:)`). The `CollectionCountCache` actor
/// dedups overlapping calls, so calling `loadCounts(forYears:)` multiple
/// times is cheap. As each (year, month) pair lands, the `@Published` dicts
/// update and dependent `YearRow` / `MonthRow` views re-render
/// progressively.
///
/// Cost (see `AGENTS.md` perf notes): a typical 10-year library is ~120
/// fetches, completing sub-second; a 30-year archive is ~360 fetches, a few
/// seconds of background work. None of it blocks the main actor — each
/// call to `cachedCountAssets` dispatches into `Task.detached` inside
/// `PhotoLibraryManager`, and the wrapper `await` here simply yields the
/// runloop while the detached fetch runs.
