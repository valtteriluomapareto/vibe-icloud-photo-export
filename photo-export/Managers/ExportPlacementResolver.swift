///
/// The only code that produces `ExportPlacement` values for collection-side selections
/// in production. Pure with respect to its inputs: same `(selection, collections,
/// existingPlacements)` triple always yields the same placement.
///
/// Identity rules (per `docs/project/plans/collections-export-plan.md` §"Placement IDs"):
/// - Timeline: `timeline:<YYYY>-<MM>`. The synthetic constructor on `ExportPlacement`
///   already handles this; the resolver is only consulted for collection selections.
/// - Favorites: fixed `collections:favorites`.
/// - Album: `collections:album:<collectionIdHash16>:<displayPathHash8>` where
///   `collectionIdHash16` is the first 16 hex chars of `SHA256(collectionLocalIdentifier)`
///   and `displayPathHash8` is the first 8 hex chars of `SHA256(parentPath || U+0000 ||
///   title)`. The path-hash makes the id change when the album is renamed or moved
///   between folders so the next export resolves to a fresh placement.
///
/// Sibling-collision disambiguation (per §"Path Policy → Disambiguation"):
/// - Two distinct placements that, after sanitization, would have the same full path
///   under the same parent folder under `Collections/Albums/` are *sibling collisions*.
/// - First claimant keeps the bare path; new placements get `_2`, `_3`, … suffixes.
/// - Stale placements from deleted albums count as live claimants so a reinstated album
///   doesn't silently steal a path.
/// - For two newly-discovered colliding albums (no existing record for either), sort
///   lexicographically by `collectionLocalIdentifier` and give the bare path to the
///   first.
