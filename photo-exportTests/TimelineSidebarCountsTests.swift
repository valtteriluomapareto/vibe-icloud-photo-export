/// Tests for the TimelineSidebarCounts loader (introduced to fix issue #20:
/// collapsed-year progress badges don't update during exports).
///
/// The bug: `TimelineSidebarView` populated `assetCountsByYearMonth` /
/// `adjustedCountsByYearMonth` lazily — only when a year was expanded
/// (`computeMonthsWithAssets(for:)`) and only when each `MonthRow` rendered
/// (`loadAdjustedCount`). For collapsed years, both dicts were empty for that
/// year's months, so `YearRow.sidebarYearExportedCount` and `yearTotal()`
/// returned 0 / nil and the badge rendered nothing.
///
/// The fix moves the dicts into a dedicated `@MainActor` `ObservableObject`
/// (`TimelineSidebarCounts`) that fans out async fetches for every year × month
/// using the existing cached count APIs. As each fetch lands, the @Published
/// dicts update and the YearRow re-renders.
///
/// These tests pin the loader's contract:
/// - `loadCounts(forYears:)` populates totals + adjusted for each (year, month).
/// - The loader uses the cached APIs (so concurrent calls dedup via
///   `CollectionCountCache`).
/// - Empty months end up with `total == 0`.
/// - The `monthsWithAssets(for:)` helper derives the per-year non-empty months
///   from the loaded totals (replaces the old `computeMonthsWithAssets`).
/// - Errors during fetch don't crash; counts that succeed still land.
