/// Reusable persistence component that backs both the timeline `ExportRecordStore` and the
/// new `CollectionExportRecordStore`. Owns the JSONL+snapshot machinery (atomic writes, log
/// replay with malformed-line skip, compaction at a mutation-count threshold) and leaves the
/// record shape and apply-log-op dispatch to the composing store.
///
/// Boundaries:
/// - **Generic owns:** snapshot read/write (atomic via `.tmp` + rename + parent-dir fsync),
///   log append (with `fsync(handle)`), log replay (with malformed-line skip), compaction
///   trigger at the mutation-count threshold, snapshot/log file-rename rotation.
/// - **Composing store owns:** the in-memory record dictionary, the apply-log-op dispatch
///   on each loaded op, the in-flight recovery pass, the `@Published` `mutationCounter`,
///   and the `RecordStoreState` machine.
///
/// Phase 0/1 of `docs/project/plans/collections-export-plan.md` motivates this extraction.
/// Two stores compose one each; both inherit the corrected fsync discipline (the existing
/// timeline `writeSnapshotAndTruncate` skipped both renames' parent-dir fsyncs, which under
/// power loss could leave a snapshot durable while the log still contained pre-snapshot
/// mutations — replaying mutations already in the snapshot on next load).
///
/// `@MainActor` isolates the calling-actor side: every entry point (`load`, `append`,
/// `writeSnapshot`, `resetToEmpty`, `clearOnDiskState`, `flushForTesting`) and every
/// mutable property (`mutationCountSinceCompact`) must be touched from the main actor.
/// Both production composing stores (`ExportRecordStore`,
/// `CollectionExportRecordStore`) are themselves `@MainActor`, so this matches how the
/// type is actually used. Off-actor work — the encode + write inside `append`'s
/// `ioQueue.async` block — happens on the dispatch queue and only reads `Sendable`
/// locals captured from the calling actor, never reaching back into `self` for
/// non-Sendable state.
